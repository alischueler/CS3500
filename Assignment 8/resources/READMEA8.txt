In our finial submission all features for interactive view are working.
  We can start, pause, resume, change speed, loop, and restart in the providers views and our views.

We found a bug in the providers text view. This was due to  toString() in their ShapeState class
having width before height. We asked the providers to fix this tiny bug and they did not respond.
